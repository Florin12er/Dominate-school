#+title: Learning styles
#+name: Sebastian

* My Main Learning Styles : 
** Auditory : 
   - I learn a lot of things by just watching somebody do something 
   - I learn faster if I discuss something about the subject rather than just learning in my own
   - I like to read out loudly
   - I like to solve problems by talking to myself

** Tactile: 
   - like typing or writing things rather than looking at images 
   - I prefer text over images
