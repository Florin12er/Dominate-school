# My Main Learning Styles :

## Auditory :

-   I learn a lot of things by just watching somebody do something
-   I learn faster if I discuss something about the subject rather than
    just learning in my own
-   I like to read out loudly
-   I like to solve problems by talking to myself

## Tactile:

-   like typing or writing things rather than looking at images
-   I prefer text over images
